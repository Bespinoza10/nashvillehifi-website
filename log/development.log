NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.

While it is easy to find amplifiers that can excel in one or two areas, the M22 is an amplifier that truly does everything well. Wide open-loop bandwidth, extremely low-phase shift, almost non-existent noise, and high current capability all add up to one incredible performance. Wielding NAD’s PowerDrive™ circuit topology, the M22 delivers unbelievable power to any loudspeaker. Distortion and noise become functionally nonexistent and nearly unmeasurable thanks to the M22’s switch mode design, resulting in a clear, amazing sound. Possessing harmonic and intermodulation distortion independent of load, as well as low output impedance uniformly at all audible frequencies, the M22 is a powerhouse unit built to break down barriers to audiophile-grade sound.", "small_img"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007fa29b9e4c48 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/var/folders/4x/p8g0ssh13tjchpd2mwcm557w0000gn/T/RackMultipart20180907-94265-1vkvwjp.jpg>, @original_filename="NAD-M22-Front.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"product[small_img]\"; filename=\"NAD-M22-Front.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">, "big_img_one"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007fa29b9e4bd0 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/var/folders/4x/p8g0ssh13tjchpd2mwcm557w0000gn/T/RackMultipart20180907-94265-a3ejl6.jpg>, @original_filename="NAD-M22-Front.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"product[big_img_one]\"; filename=\"NAD-M22-Front.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">, "big_img_two"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007fa29b9e4b30 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/var/folders/4x/p8g0ssh13tjchpd2mwcm557w0000gn/T/RackMultipart20180907-94265-sjsl86.jpg>, @original_filename="NAD-M22-back.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"product[big_img_two]\"; filename=\"NAD-M22-back.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Create Product"}

Wielding NAD’s PowerDrive™ circuit topology, the M22 delivers unbelievable power to any loudspeaker. Distortion and noise become functionally nonexistent and nearly unmeasurable thanks to the M22’s switch mode design, resulting in a clear, amazing sound. Possessing harmonic and intermodulation distortion independent of load, as well as low output impedance uniformly at all audible frequencies, the M22 is a powerhouse unit built to break down barriers to audiophile-grade sound."], ["created_at", "2018-09-07 06:35:14.464466"], ["updated_at", "2018-09-07 06:35:14.464466"], ["small_img_file_name", "NAD-M22-Front.jpg"], ["small_img_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["small_img_file_size", 80874], ["small_img_updated_at", "2018-09-07 06:35:12.627420"], ["big_img_one_file_name", "NAD-M22-Front.jpg"], ["big_img_one_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["big_img_one_file_size", 80874], ["big_img_one_updated_at", "2018-09-07 06:35:13.277025"], ["big_img_two_file_name", "NAD-M22-back.jpg"], ["big_img_two_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["big_img_two_file_size", 122252], ["big_img_two_updated_at", "2018-09-07 06:35:13.885392"], ["product_type", "Streaming Audio"], ["color", "Black"]]

Wide open-loop bandwidth, extremely low-phase shift, almost non-existent noise, harmonic and intermodulation distortion independent of load (load invariant), high current capability, low output impedance (high damping factor) uniformly at all audible frequencies—it all adds up to incredible performance. You just have to hear it to feel it."}, "commit"=>"Update Product", "id"=>"4"}

Wielding NAD’s PowerDrive™ circuit topology, the M22 delivers unbelievable power to any loudspeaker. Distortion and noise become functionally nonexistent and nearly unmeasurable thanks to the M22’s switch mode design, resulting in a clear, amazing sound.
